# Implimentation-of-linked-list-applications
This project is about Implementation of linked list applications. The main aim of this project is to implement one of the most important applications of linked list such as polynomial operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication and derivation. To perform these operations each polynomial needs to represent in one linked list and each node in the list contains three parts to store coefficient, exponent and link to next term of polynomial respectively. We can learn about linked list , polynomial expressions in this project.
